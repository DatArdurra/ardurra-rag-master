### Clone & Setup
 
1. Create a new folder and switch to it in the terminal:
 
   ```bash
   mkdir ardurra-rag && cd ardurra-rag
   ```
 
2. Clone the repository and switch to the correct branch:
 
   ```bash

### Azure Authentication
 
1. Login to Azure:
 
   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```
 
2. Create the following folder structure in your project:
 
   ```
   .azure/idm-tceq/.env
   ```
 
   > **Reach out to `PSharma@ardurra.com` to get the `.env` file.**
 
3. Set this environment as default:
 
   ```bash
   azd env select idm-tceq
   ```

### Start the App
 
#### For Windows PowerShell users:
 
Temporarily allow script execution:
 
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```
 
Then start the server:
 
```powershell
./app/start.ps1
```
 
#### For Linux/macOS:
 
```bash
./app/start.sh
```

### Frontend Hot Reloading (Optional)
 
In a new terminal window:
 
```bash
cd app/frontend
npm install         # Only needed once
npm run dev
```
 
Expected output:
 
```shell
> frontend@0.0.0 dev
> vite
 
  VITE v4.5.1  ready in 957 ms
 
  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```
 
Visit that URL in your browser to see the live frontend. Vite will auto-reload on changes.
 
All backend API calls are proxied to the Python server, as defined in `vite.config.ts`.

## Notes
 
- No need to run `azd up` if you're using pre-provisioned Azure services.
- Make sure your `.env` file has correct and complete Azure values, especially for OpenAI, CosmosDB, and Search.
- Backend uses `Quart`, OpenTelemetry, and other modern observability tools.
